          <h1><span style="background-color: #FFF98C">Hiya, I'm Sara!</span></h1>
          <p>I don’t know if I was born a people watcher, but I sure have become one. I love watching what brings a smile to strangers’ faces. It feels like a good balance between the analytic and the empathic. It’s this balance that informs my approach to every kind of design (branding, editorial, interactive) and illustration I do. And somehow I keep track of all my thinking on sticky notes. On average I go through a pack every two weeks. But, I guess I’ll have to wait for COVID to be over before I go back to people watching because people watching over Zoom is plain creepy.</p>

          <p><span style="background-color: #FFF98C">Guilty Pleasures include:</span></p>
          
          <p>—Reading way too much manga.</p>
          
        <p>—Singing to relieve stress often to the dismay of others in ear shot.</p>
          
        <p>—Cooking… but I have another bad habit of getting distracted and letting things burn. I have severely ruined 2 pans and compromised 3 others. I also sing when I cook.</p>
